# DBD-JDBC

This module allows you to use DBI to access a JDBC driver from
Perl and is implemented in a fashion similar to that of
DBD::Proxy. There are two components: a pure Perl DBD::JDBC
module, and a pure Java server application. Both must be
installed in order to use this driver, though, like DBD::Proxy,
they may be installed on separate machines.

See the documentation in the Perl module directory for more
information.
